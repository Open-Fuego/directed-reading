# Independent Study Web Text
Abstract: This repository will allow the user to mix and match div. blocks to build a quick web communication similar to an Adobe Spark. https://spark.adobe.com...but through the process the user will learn more about computer science and computer literacy. 
    
## Get started!

1. Fork this repository.

2. Download the webtext to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means).

3. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and where you will organize your other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

4. Download and/or open a text editor like [brackets.io](https://brackets.io), [atom.io](https://atom.io), or [notepad-plus-plus.org](notepad-plus-plus.org). 

5. In that text editor, open the style.css and index.html documents from this folder.  

6. Start reading the index.html in text editor and you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text!

7. Once you have modified and added your files, return to your repository and upload (push) your files. Hit "Commit!" 

8. To publish, go to the repository settings, scroll down, scroll down, until you see "GitHub Pages." Here you will change "source" from "none" to "master branch." This will publish your Pitt Fuego online and generate a link. Now it's time to spread the fire! Congratulations.
